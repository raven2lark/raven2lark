👋 Hi, I'm Raven, and I'm on a journey of transitioning into the exciting world of data analytics. My academic background is in physics, but after several years working as a contract administrator, I'm eager to dive into the world of data analytics.

📊 I'm passionate about the power of data to uncover insights and drive informed decisions. My journey has led me to explore data analytics, and I have honed my skills in Excel, R, SQL, Tableau and PowerBI.

🔍 As I transition into this field, I'm excited to explore areas such as data visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling. I'm open to new opportunities and am always eager to expand my skills.
